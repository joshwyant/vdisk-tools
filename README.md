# vdisk-tools
Command-line tools for writing disk images, and a GUI for exploring them.

I made these tools in 2008 with a UI to create and modify disk images.

I used them for building my hobby operating system at the time (https://github.com/joshwyant/myos).

In 2018 (10 years later), I published the tools to github, converted the command-line tools to dotnet core,
and published a docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/joshwyant/vdisk-tools/). 

The docker image doesn't contain the GUI.
